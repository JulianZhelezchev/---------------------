                            <h5>Learning the basics</h5>
                            <p>&emsp;&emsp;Let's start with the obvious: Surfboards are made to float on the water. They have a natural center of gravity. If you were to lay any surfboard in a swimming pool, it would come to rest the same way every time. This is what we want to do when you lay on a surf board. That is to have the board remain in the same relation to the water as it was without your weight on it, just a bit lower in the water. A good tip is to find this balance point and lay on your board, then make a mark right at your chin. This mark is best made with a bit of wax or a magic marker. It is a reference point that enables you to put your chin on the same spot every time so the board will react to your weight the same way every time.</p>
                            <p>&emsp;&emsp;Too much weight in the back and the board will cork. This is a common mistake amongst beginners. You cannot catch a wave if you are corking your board. Move up an inch at a time till the board lies in the water naturally. This will provide you with the maximum hull speed and minimum drag from the water displacement that you are causing with your weight.</p>
                            <h5>Surf Lessons vs. Self Taught  </h5>
                            <p>&emsp;&emsp;A lot of surfers have mastered the art of riding a wave all by themselves. They bought a surfboard and mimicked fellow surfers. It worked out, and that's great.
                                    Tips from friends and even anonymous surfers that are willing to share a few practical suggestions and recommendations on how to start surfing could be extremely helpful, too.
                                    However, you may learn faster if you book a few surf lessons. Surf instructors will guide through the critical early stages of lying on a surfboard and finding the balance while standing up.</p>
